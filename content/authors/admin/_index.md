## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston. My research interests include legislative politics, public opinion, and political behavior, with a particular focus on how voters perceive and evaluate the behavior of political elites and how elites and voters influence each other. Methodologically, I employ quantitative methods, survey research, and survey experiments. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received both my M.A. and B.A. in Political Science from Tunghai University in Taiwan.
